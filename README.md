# 2048
A simple implementation of 2048 game. 

This is a pet-project and a playgroung to test functional programming features of the Kotlin language — lambda expressions, extension functions — as well as Kotlin coding conventions.

• This project does not have any UI beside run terminal.\
• The project does not save state, so after stopping the application, all the progress will be lost.\
• To play the game, run the application. Use WASD keys on the keyboard for controls. \
• To exit the game, stop the application. Otherwise, game will be over if the player collects 2048 points(win) or will not have available moves left(lose).
